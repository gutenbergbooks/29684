<h3><a name = "intro" id = "intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h3>


<p>Perhaps no higher praise can be paid a translator than posterity’s
acceptance of his work. Laurence Echard’s <i>Terence’s Comedies</i>,
first printed in 1694 in the dress and phraseology of Restoration
comedy, has received this accolade through the mediation of no less a
modern translator than Robert Graves. In 1963 Graves edited a
translation of three of Terence’s plays. His Foreword points to the
extreme difficulty of translating Terence, and admits his own
failure&mdash; “It is regrettable that the very terseness of his Latin
makes an accurate English rendering read drily and flatly; as I have
found to my disappointment.” Graves’s answer was typically
idiosyncratic. “A&nbsp;revival of Terence in English, must,
I&nbsp;believe, be based on the translation made .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
with fascinating vigour, by a young Cambridge student Laurence Echard
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href =
"#note1">1</a></p>

<p>The Prefaces to Echard’s <i>Terence’s Comedies: Made English</i>
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (1694) and to his <i>Plautus’s Comedies,
Amphitryon, Epidicus, and Rudens</i> (1694) are of interest for several
reasons. Both of them outline the intentions and rationale which lie
behind the translations. They also throw light upon the sense of
literary rivalry with French achievements which existed in some quarters
in late seventeenth-century England, make comments on the contemporary
stage, and are valuable both as examples of seventeenth-century
attitudes to two Classical dramatists, and as statements of neoclassical
dramatic theory. Finally, they are, to some extent, polemical pieces,
aiming at the instruction of contemporary dramatists.</p>

<p>Laurence Echard, or Eachard (1670?-1730), was a minor cleric,
a&nbsp;prolific hack, and an historian, a&nbsp;typical enough confusion
of functions for the time. It suggests that Echard had energy, ability,
and political commitment, but lacked a generous patron or good fortune
to take the place of private means. Within the Church his success was
modest: he was installed prebendary
<span class = "pagenum">ii</span>
<!-- png 04 -->
of Louth in 1697, but had to wait until 1712 before becoming Archdeacon
of Stow. Echard achieved the little fame by which he is remembered as an
historical writer. Perhaps he is more accurately described as a compiler
rather than as an historian. His major works were <i>The Roman History,
from the Building of the City, to the Perfect Settlement of the Empire
by Augustus Caesar</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (1695-98), the equally
comprehensive <i>A General Ecclesiastical History from the Nativity of
Our Blessed Saviour to the First Establishment of Christianity</i>
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (1702), his all-inclusive <i>The History of England from
the first Entrance of Julius Caesar .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to the Conclusion of
the Reign of King James the Second</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (1707-18), and
the more detailed but equally long work, <i>The History of the
Revolution, and the Establishment of England in .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 1688</i>
(1725).</p>

<p>Echard’s career as a publisher’s jack-of-all-trades ran concurrently
with his life’s work on history, and showed a similar taste for the
voluminously encyclopedic. In 1691 he graduated B.A. at Christ’s
College, Cambridge, and published four works under the imprint of Thomas
<ins class = "correction" title = "correct spelling">Salusbury</ins>:
<i>A&nbsp;Most Complete Compendium of Geography; General and Special;
Describing all the Empires, Kingdoms, and Dominions in the Whole
World</i>, <i>An Exact Description of Ireland .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i>, <i>A
Description of Flanders .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i>, and the <i>Duke of Savoy’s
Dominions most accurately described</i>.<a class = "tag" name = "tag2"
id = "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a> These were followed in 1692 by <i>The
Gazetteer’s or Newsman’s Interpreter: being a Geographical Index</i>
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Two years later the translations of Plautus and
Terence were published.</p>

<p>All of this work was clearly irrelevant to his main interests: in
1695 he had been urged to undertake his <i>General Ecclesiastical
History</i>, and by that time he was already at work upon his <i>Roman
History</i> (1695-98).<a class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href =
"#note3">3</a> Into the bargain, he was in residence at Cambridge until
1695, for he did not gain his M.A. until that year. Despite the apparent
success of his publisher’s enterprises (<i>A&nbsp;Most Complete
Compendium</i> was in its eighth edition by 1713, and <i>The Gazetteer’s
or Newsman’s Interpreter</i> reached a twelfth in 1724), little of the
profit reached the penurious Echard. In 1717 Archbishop Wake wrote to
Addison that
<span class = "pagenum">iii</span>
<!-- png 05 -->
“His circumstances are so much worse than I thought, that if we cannot
get somewhat pretty considerable for Him, I&nbsp;doubt He will sink
under the weight of his debts .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”<a class = "tag"
name = "tag4" id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a></p>

<p>The sheer quantity of work which Echard accomplished in these early
years is astonishing: it is no wonder that in the Preface to the
<i>Plautus</i> he explained that “business” had prevented him from
translating more than three of the comedies, remarking, “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I have taken somewhat less time than was necessary for the translating
such an extraordinary difficult Author; for this requires more than
double the time of an <i>Historian</i> or the like, which was as much as
I cou’d allow my self” (sig.&nbsp;b3).</p>

<p>In all of his work Echard sought and acknowledged the help of a whole
series of unnamed encouragers and authorities. For the <i>Plautus</i> he
“had the Advantage of another’s doing their <ins class = "correction"
title = "all bracketed notes are in the original">[i.e., ”these“?]</ins>
Plays before me; from whose Translation I had very considerable Helps
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” (sig. b4). Apart from that aid, the <i>Plautus</i>, on
the evidence offered by the title-page and the Preface, was all Echard’s
own. This is not the case with the <i>Terence</i>, which was translated
by a symposium, with the Preface being written by Echard on the group’s
behalf. As a result, its Preface uses “we” throughout where the
<i>Plautus</i> uses “I.” When the first edition of the <i>Terence</i>
appeared it gave the authorship as “By Several Hands,” but later
editions are more detailed, and specify that the work was done “By Mr.
Laurence Echard, and others. Revis’d and Corrected by Dr. Echard and Sir
R. L’Estrange.” The fourth edition also stated firmly in 1716, “The
PREFACE, Written by Mr. <i>Laurence Echard</i>” (p.&nbsp;i).</p>

<p>The only discrepancy which might seem to deny Echard’s authorship of
the Preface to the <i>Terence</i> is the fact that the two Prefaces
contradict one another over the way in which scenes should be marked.
The Preface to the <i>Terence</i> simply says that exits and entrances
within the acts are a sufficient indication that the scene has changed
without numbering them, “for the <i>Ancients</i> never had any other
[method] that we know of” (p.&nbsp;xxii). The <i>Plautus</i> on the
other hand, numbers the scenes, and the Preface comments, “I&nbsp;have
all the way divided the <i>Acts</i> and
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
<!-- png 06 -->
<i>Scenes</i> according to the true Rules of the Stage .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
(sig. b2<sup>v</sup>). Since this was an open question, however, in
neoclassical dramatic theory, the simplest explanation is that Echard
was free to do as he believed in the <i>Plautus</i>, which was all his
own, but was, in the Preface to the <i>Terence</i>, expressing the views
of the whole group of translators.</p>

<p>The two volumes are a testimony to Echard’s remarkable industry and
abilities. They were published the year before he took his M.A., when he
was only twenty-four. In the years between coming up to Cambridge in
1687 and 1695, he found time not only to satisfy his university, and to
do the very considerable amount of hack work which appeared in 1691 and
1692, as well as embarking upon his large historical works, but also
translated two difficult Roman authors with great verve.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know why, in the years between 1691 and
1694, Echard turned his attentions to the art of translation. The
venture is a curious deviation from his otherwise single-minded devotion
to history and to journalistic enterprises (the only other translation
he is known to have done is the brief “Auction of the Philosophers” in
<i>The Works of Lucian</i> [1710-11]). The connection of Dr. John
Eachard and Sir Roger L’Estrange may offer a slight clue. Echard was
closely related to Dr. Eachard (1636?-1697), Master of Catharine Hall,
Cambridge, and author of the lively dialogue, <i>Mr. Hobbs’s State of
Nature Consider’d</i> (1672).<a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id = "tag5"
href = "#note5">5</a> With a family connection such as this, Echard
might well have hoped for a successful career centered on his stay at
Cambridge. The dedication of his <i>A Most Complete Compendium</i> in
1691 to the Master of his own college, Dr. John Covel, suggests that he
was looking in this direction. L’Estrange is important not only for his
intimate knowledge of the publishing trade, but also because he was a
translator in his own right. His <i>Æsop</i> appeared in 1692, and he
had early put out translations of Quevedo (1673), Cicero (1680), and
Erasmus (1680), and was to go on to translate Flavius Josephus (1702).
Since L’Estrange had also been a student at Cambridge, there is some
possibility that the
<span class = "pagenum">v</span>
<!-- png 07 -->
translation of Terence was carried out at the instigation of a Cambridge
based group. The translation might also be connected with the resurgence
of interest in translation and in “correctness” which can be discerned
in the 1690’s.<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6" href =
"#note6">6</a></p>

<p>The two Prefaces differ somewhat in character. It seems clear from
remarks made in the Preface to the <i>Plautus</i> that it was written
after the <i>Terence</i> had already reached the public and after
Echard’s copy for the text of Plautus’s three comedies was in the
printer’s hands. Not surprisingly the later Preface is hurried, and at
times almost casual. The Preface to the <i>Terence</i> is more
ambitious, more carefully written, and more wide-ranging, though giving
fewer examples of the kinds of translations made by Echard. Both
Prefaces lay claim to substantially the same audience. That to the
<i>Terence</i> explains that the translation was undertaken in the first
place because of the literary value of Terence’s comedy. In consequence,
its benefits would apply to “most sorts of People, but especially for
the Service it may do our <i>Dramatick Poets</i>.” Secondly, the work
was undertaken for “the Honour of our own <i>Language</i>, into which
all good Books ought to be Translated, since <i>’tis now become so
Elegant, Sweet and Copious</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Thirdly, it might
rival the translations done in other countries, particularly those in
France. The audience envisaged ranged from schoolboys, who would find
the translation less Latinate and the notes more pointed than those of
Bernard or Hoole, to “Men of Sense and Learning,” who ought to be
pleased to see Terence in “modern Dress.” As for the dramatists, Terence
might serve as an exemplar, especially since the translation could “be
read with less Trouble than the Original .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” (pp.
xvii-xix). The <i>Plautus</i> Preface is far less detailed, but refers
back to these reasons, while stressing the function of the translation
for the schoolboy. Judging by the number of editions, the <i>Terence</i>
found its market, for where the <i>Plautus</i> ran to only two editions,
the first and that of 1716, the <i>Terence</i> appeared in a seventh
edition in 1729. Nor was Echard’s audience merely made up of students.
If one of his main targets was contemporary dramatists, he would have
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
<!-- png 08 -->
been elated to learn that William Congreve owned a copy of the first
edition of both translations.<a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id = "tag7"
href = "#note7">7</a></p>

<p>The Prefaces are perhaps a little disingenuous in acknowledging
Echard’s and his collaborators’ debt to the contemporary French
classical scholar and translator, Anne Dacier. On both occasions Echard
paid her some tribute. What he does not mention is that the two volumes
seem to be modelled on her example. The <i>Terence</i> translates the
plays which had appeared in her <i>Les comédies de Térence</i> (Paris,
1688), and it is significant that despite his claims that he wished to
translate more than three of Plautus’ comedies, he in fact translated
only those three which Mme. Dacier had already done in her <i>Les
comédies de Plaute</i> (Paris, 1683). Moreover, the notes and to some
extent the Prefaces, are modelled on the French scholar’s work: Echard’s
notes are often directly dependent upon Mme. Dacier’s and are exactly
described by her account of her own volume as being “avec de remarques
et un examen de chaque comédie selon les règles du theatre.”</p>

<p>The views on translation put forward by the Prefaces are an
intelligent exposition of progressive contemporary notions of the art.
The belief in literal translation which characterizes Jonson and Marvell
in the earlier years of the century had been displaced by the more
liberal concept of “imitation.” Roscommon is a representative of this
freer attitude, while Dryden’s more severe theory of “paraphrase,”
whatever his practice may have been, stands somewhere between the two
positions. Like Ozell and Gildon, and later Pope, Echard’s aim, whether
translating by himself or collectively, was to imitate the spirit of his
author in English. “A&nbsp;meer <i>Verbal Translation</i> is not to be
expected, that wou’d sound so horribly, and be more obscure than the
Original .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We couldn’t have kept closer
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. without too much treading upon the Author’s Heels, and
destroying our Design of giving it an easie, <i>Comick Style</i>, most
agreeable to our present Times” (<i>Terence’s Comedies</i>, p.&nbsp;xx).
To this end it was necessary to tone down the “familiarity and bluntness
in [Terence’s] Discourse” which were “not so agreeable with the Manners
and
<span class = "pagenum">vii</span>
<!-- png 09 -->
Gallantry of our Times.” This was intended to bring Terence up to the
level of gentility for which he was credited by compensating for the
barbarity of Roman social manners. But the translation was willing to go
further than this: it added to the Roman comedy what Echard thought
English comedy excelled in, “humour”&mdash; “In some places we have had
somewhat more of <i>Humour</i> than the Original, to make it still more
agreeable to our Age .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” (<i>ibid.</i>,
p.&nbsp;xxii). When speaking for himself alone in the Preface to the
<i>Plautus</i>, Echard’s claims were less grandiose. Here the
translation seems much more specifically aimed at schoolboys, and Echard
made firm claims for his literalness (sig. b1-2<sup>v</sup>). On the
other hand, he went out of his way to praise Dryden’s <i>Amphitryon</i>
(1690) for the freedom it had taken with the original, which, said
Echard, “may serve for one Instance of what Improvements our Modern
Poets have made on the Ancients, when they built upon their Foundations”
(sig. b3<sup>v</sup>-4).</p>

<p>The praise of Dryden is to some extent double-edged since it is an
implicit assertion of the point made in both Prefaces, that English
writers had much to learn from the Roman dramatists. Echard uses the
Prefaces to assess and compare Plautus and Terence, but he also uses
them as a springboard for a critique of the state of English comedy.
Like much neoclassical criticism it is, of course, derivative. The stock
comparison of Plautus and Terence comes from Anne Dacier,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag8" id = "tag8" href = "#note8">8</a> and Echard’s
footprints can be tracked in the snows of Cicero, Scaliger, Rapin, André
Dacier, the Abbé D’Aubignac, and Dryden. Having set the Ancients against
the Moderns, Echard is able to attack the looseness of English double
plots by pointing to Terence’s success within a similar structure. He is
also able to praise Terence’s genteel style. Against this, Echard
admits, along with his precursors, Plautus’ superiority in point of
<i>vis comica</i>, which he defines, interestingly, as “<i>Liveliness of
Intreague</i>” (sig. a8). Echard is thus able to claim, with
considerable conviction, the superiority of English comedy in several
areas, especially in its variety, its humour, “in some Delicacies of
<i>Conversation</i>,” and “above all in <i>Repartée</i>” (<i>Terence’s
Comedies</i>, p.&nbsp;xi).</p>

<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
<!-- png 10 -->
<p>What the English had to learn, in Echard’s view, was “regularity,”
that is, the discipline imposed upon a dramatist by observing the
Unities, and obeying the other “rules of the drama” (such as the
<i>liaisons</i>), in pursuit of verisimilitude and tautness of
structure. Echard’s main hope was that his translation and notes would
correct his contemporaries’ habit of ignoring the Roman dramatists’
“<i>essential</i> Beauties,” and “contenting themselves with considering
the <i>superficial</i> ones, such as the <i>Stile</i>, <i>Language</i>,
<i>Expression</i>, and the like, without taking much notice of the
Contrivance and Management, of the <i>Plots, Characters, etc.</i>”
(<i>Plautus</i>, sig. a1). The remarkable fact about Echard’s discussion
of these matters, despite his dependence at times upon that arch-pedant,
the Abbé D’Aubignac,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9" id = "tag9" href =
"#note9">9</a> is the critical intelligence with which he puts forward
his argument. Unlike many neoclassical critics, Echard keeps his eyes
fixed firmly on the strengths and weaknesses of Restoration comedy
within the context of previous English comedy and the Restoration stage
itself. A&nbsp;sign of this is his attention to practical details, which
take the form of one or two valuable notes on the theatre of his day. We
learn, for instance, that actors were in the “custom of looking
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. full upon the Spectators,” and that some members of the
Restoration audience took printed copies into the playhouse in order to
be able to follow the play on the stage.<a class = "tag" name = "tag10"
id = "tag10" href = "#note10">10</a> It is a real loss to the historian
of drama and to the critic that these two volumes were Laurence Echard’s
solitary adventure into the criticism and translation of drama.</p>

<h4>THE</h4>

<h1><span class = "extended">PREFACE</span>.</h1>


<p><span class = "firstletter">S</span>Ince long <em>Prefaces</em> are
lately much in Fashion upon this and the like Occasions, why may not we
be allow’d some tolerable Liberty in this kind; provided we keep close
to our Author, and our own Translation of him. As for our Author,
wherever Learning, Wit or Judgment have flourish’d, this Poet has always
had an extraordinary Reputation. To mention all his Excellencies and
Perfections were a Task too difficult for us, and perhaps for the
greatest Criticks alive; so very few there are that perfectly understand
all of ’em; yet we shall venture at some of the most Remarkable.</p>

<p>To begin with him in general. He was certainly the most Exact, the
most Elaborate, and withal the most Natural of all <em>Dramatick</em>
Poets; His <em>Stile</em> so neat and pure, his <em>Characters</em> so
true and perfect, his <em>Plots</em> so regular and probable, and almost
every thing so absolutely just and agreeable, that he may well seem to
merit that Praise which several have given him, <em>That he was the most
correct Author in the World.</em> To compare him with <em>Plautus</em>,
the other great <em>Latin Comedian</em>, we may observe that
<em>Plautus</em> had more Wit and Spirit, but <em>Terence</em> more
Sense and Judgment; the former’s Stile was rich and glaring, the
latter’s more close and even: <em>Plautus</em> had the most dazelling
out-side, and the most lively Colours, but <em>Terence</em> drew the
finest Figures and Postures,
<span class = "pagenum">ii</span>
<!-- png 16 -->
and had the best Design; the one pleas’d the Vulgar, but our Author the
Better sort of people; the former wou’d usually set his Spectators into
a loud Laughter, but the latter steal ’em into a sweet Smile that shou’d
continue from the beginning to the end of the Representation: in short,
<em>Plautus</em> was more lively and vigorous, and so fitter for
<em>Action</em>; and <em>Terence</em> more grave and serious, and so
fitter for <em>Reading</em>. Tho’ <em>Plautus</em>’s Beauties were very
extraordinary, yet he had his Faults and Indecorums very frequent; but
<em>Terence</em>’s Excellencies (tho’ possibly inferior to some of the
others) were more general, better dispers’d, and closer continu’d; and
his Faults so inconsiderable, and so very few, that <em>Scaliger</em>
said, <em>There were not three to be found throughout the Six
Plays.</em> So that our Author seems to want nothing to make him
absolutely compleat, but only that same <em>Vis Comica</em> that
<em>Cæsar</em> wishes he had, and which <em>Plautus</em> was Master of
in such a high degree. We shall determine nothing between ’em, but leave
’em good Friends as we found&nbsp;’em.</p>

<p>This may be sufficient for our Author’s Excellencies in general; for
his particular ones, we shall begin with his Stile, a&nbsp;thing he has
been admir’d for in all Ages, and truly he deserves it; for certainly no
one was ever more accurate, natural, and clear in his Expressions than
he. But to be a little more particular in this Matter, we shall give you
some few of our Author’s Excellencies in this kind under three or four
different Heads.</p>

<p>And first, We may observe of his <em>Words</em>, that they are
generally nicely chosen, extreamly proper and significant; and many of
’em carry so much Life and Force in ’em, that they can hardly be
express’d in any other Language without great disadvantage to the
Original. To instance in these following. <em>Qui cum ingeniis
<i>conflictatur</i> ejusmodi. Ut animus in spe atque in timore usque
ante hac <i>attentus</i> fuit. Nisi me lactasses amantem, &amp; falsa
spe <i>produceres</i>. <i>Pam.</i> Mi Pater. <i>Si.</i> Quid mi Pater?
Quasi tu
<span class = "pagenum">iii</span>
<span class = "folionum">A3</span>
<!-- png 17 -->
<i>hujus indigeas</i> Patris. Tandem ego non illâ caream, si sit opus,
vel totum triduum. <i>Par.</i> Hui? <i>Universum triduum.</i> Quam
<i>elegans</i> formarum spectator siem. Hunc comedendum &amp; deridendum
vobis <i>propino</i>.</em></p>

<p>We shall next take notice of one or two Instances of the Shortness
and Clearness of his Narrations; as that which <em>Tully</em> mentions.
<em>Funus interim procedit sequimur, ad Sepulchrum venimus, in ignem
posita est, Fletur.</em> Another may be that in <em>Phormio</em>.
<em>Persuasum est homini, factum est, ventum est, vincimur,
duxit.</em></p>

<p>Another remarkable Beauty of his Stile appears in his Climaxes; where
every Word is Emphatical, heightens the Sense, and adds considerably to
what went before. As, <em>Hæc verba Mehercule una falsa Lachrymula, quam
oculos terendo miserè vix vi expresserit, restinguet. Quod ille unciatim
vix de <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘demcuso’">demenso</ins> suo, suum <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘defrudans’">defraudans</ins> genium, comparsit
miser.</em></p>

<p>The last thing we shall give any instance of, is the Softness and
Delicacy of his Turns; of which many might be produced; but we think
these few may be sufficient for our purpose. <em><ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘Ehen’">Eheu</ins> me miseram! Cur non
aut isthæc mihi ætas &amp; forma est, aut tibi hæc sententia. Nam si ego
digna hac contumelia sum maxime, at tu indignus qui faceres tamen. Nam
dum abs te absum, omnes mihi labores fuere, quos cepi, leves, præterquam
tui carendum quod erat. Palam beatus, ni unum <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘de sit’">desit</ins>, animus qui modeste isthæc
ferat. Aliis, quia defit quod amant, ægre est, tibi, quod super est,
dolet.</em> And as for the Purity of his Language in general; we find it
very much commended even by <em>Tully</em> himself. And <em>One</em> of
the Moderns is not at all out of the way when he tells us: That the
<em>Latin</em> Tongue will never be lost, as long as <em>Terence</em>
may be had.</p>

<p>Our Author’s Excellent <em>Latin</em> is now the greatest Cause of
his Esteem, and makes him so much read in the World; but for certain, he
that reads him purely for his <em>Latin</em>
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
<!-- png 18 -->
sake, does but a quarter read him; for ’tis his <em>Characters</em> and
<em>Plots</em> have so far rais’d him up above the rest of the Poets,
and have gain’d him so much Honour among the Criticks in all Ages. His
<em>Stile</em>, tho’ so very extraordinary, in a great measure may be
learnt by Industry, long Custom, and continual Usage, and has been
imitated to a high degree by several; and indeed this was but as rich
Attire, and outward Ornaments to set off a more beautiful Body. But in
his <em>Characters</em> and <em>Manners</em> there it is that he
triumphs without a Rival; and not only <em>Dramatick</em>, but all other
Poets must yield to him in that Point. For these are drawn exactly to
the Life, perfectly just<ins class = "correction" title = ". for,">,
</ins>truly proportionably, and fully kept up to the last; and as for
their being natural, <em>Rapin</em> says, <em>That no Man living had a
greater insight into Nature than he.</em> The more a Man looks into ’em,
the more he must admire ’em; he’ll find there not only such Beauty in
his <em>Images</em>, but also such excellent Precepts of
<em>Morality</em>, such solid Sense in each Line, such depth of
Reasoning in each Period, and such close arguing between each Party,
that he must needs perceive him to be a Person of strong Sense and
Judgment. His <em>Deliberations</em> are most compleat, where all the
several Accidents, Events, Dangers, Casualties, good and bad
Consequences are fully summed up and clearly urg’d; so are the
<em>Answers</em> of each Person as perfect, where every thing is so well
fitted, so home, and so natural, that if one shou’d study upon ’em never
so long, he cou’d scarce find any thing more to the purpose. He had a
peculiar Happiness at pleasing and amusing an Audience, perpetually
keeping ’em in a most even, pleasant, smiling Temper; and this is the
most distinguishing part of his Character from the rest of the World;
his Pleasantries were somewhat Manly, and such as reach’d beyond the
Fancy and Imagination, even to the Heart and Soul of the Audience; and
what is more remarkable yet,
<span class = "pagenum">v</span>
<span class = "folionum">A4</span>
<!-- png 19 -->
one single Scene shall please a whole day together; a&nbsp;Secret which
few or no other Poet ever found out.</p>

<p>And as we have scarce found one Man in the World that equals him in
his Characters, so we find but very few that cou’d come up to him in the
Management (we mean his Art and Contrivance) of his <em>Plots</em>. We
are sensible that many have been so foolish as to count his Plays a
<em>bare Bundle of Dialogues dress’d up in a neat Stile</em>, and there
all his Excellency to consist, or at least that they are very ordinary
and mean; but such senseless Suppositions will soon vanish upon giving
an Account of the Nature and Perfection of ’em. He well understood the
Rules of the Stage, or rather those of <em>Nature</em>; was perfectly
<em>Regular</em>, wonderful exact and careful in ordering each
<em>Protasis</em> or Entrance, <em>Epitasis</em> or working up,
<em>Catastasis</em> or heighth, and <em>Catastrophe</em> or unravelling
the Plot; which last he was famous for making it spring necessarily from
the Incidents, and neatly and dextrously untying the Knot, whilst others
of a grosser make, would either tear, or cut it in pieces. In short
(setting aside some few things which we shall mention by and by)
<em>Terence</em> may serve for the best and most perfect <em>Model</em>
for our <em>Dramatick</em> Poets to imitate, provided they exactly
observe the different Customs and Manners of the <em>Roman</em> and
<em>English</em> People; and upon the same account we beg leave to be a
little more particular in this Matter, which dispos’d us very much to
this Translation.</p>

<p>The Nature of his <em>Plots</em> was for the most part grave and
solid, and sometimes passionate a little, resembling our Modern
<em>Tragy-Comedies</em>; only the Comical parts were seldom so merry;
the Thinness and clearness of ’em somewhat resembling our Modern
<em>Tragedies</em>, only more perfect in the latter, and not crouded
with too many Incidents. They were all double except the
<em>Hecyra</em>, or <em>Mother-in-Law</em>, yet so contriv’d that one
was always an <em>Under-plot</em> to the other: So that he still kept
perfectly to the first great
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
<!-- png 20 -->
Rule of the Stage, the <em>Unity of Action</em>. As for the second great
Rule the <em>Unity of Time</em> (that is, for the whole Action to be
perform’d in the compass of a Day) he was as exact in that as possible,
for the longest Action of any of his Plays reaches not Eleven hours. He
was no less careful in the third Rule, <em>The Unity of Place</em>, for
’tis plain he never shifts his Scene in any one of his Plays, but keeps
constantly to the same place from the beginning to the end. Then for the
<em>Continuance in the Action</em>, he never fails in any one place<ins
class = "correction" title = ". for ,">, </ins>but every Instrument is
perpetually at work in carrying on their several Designs, and in them
the design of the whole; so that the Stage never grows cold till all is
finish’d: And to do this the more handsomely and dextrously, he scarce
ever brings an <em>Actor</em> upon the Stage, but you presently know his
Name and Quality, what part of the Intrigue he’s to promote, why he came
there, from whence he came, why just at that time, why he goes <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘of’">off</ins>, where he’s a
going, and also what he is or ought to be doing or contriving all the
time he’s away. His <em>Scenes</em> are always unbroken, so that the
Stage is never perfectly clear but between the Acts; but are continually
joyn’d by one of the four Unions. Which according to <em>Mon.
Hedelin</em> are these; <em>Presence</em>, <em>Seeking</em>,
<em>Noise</em>, or <em>Time</em>; and when the Action ceaseth (that is,
upon the Stage) and the Stage is clear’d, an <em>Act</em> is then
finish’d. Then for <em>Incidents</em>, and the due Preparation of ’em,
<em>Terence</em> was admirable: And the true and exact Management of
<em>these</em> is one of the most difficult parts of <em>Dramatick
Poetry</em>. He contrives every thing in such a manner so as to fall out
most probably and naturally, and when they are over they seem almost
necessary; yet by his excellent Skill he so cunningly conceals the
Events of things from his Audience, till due time, that they can never
foresee ’em; by this means they are so amus’d with the <em>Actors</em>
Designs, that the <em>Poets</em> is unknown to ’em, till at last, being
all along in the dark, they are surpriz’d
<span class = "pagenum">vii</span>
<!-- png 21 -->
most agreeably by something they never look’d for: And this is the most
taking and the most delightful part of a Play. We might insist much more
largely upon each of these Particulars, and upon several others, but at
present we shall content our selves with saying that these
<em>Plots</em> are all so very <em>clear</em>, and <em>natural</em>,
that they might very well go for a Representation of a thing that had
really happen’d; and not the meer Invention of the <em>Poet</em>.</p>

<p>There are two or three remarkable Objections against our Author which
we can’t but take notice of. First, ’tis said, <em>That he has not kept
to the Unity of Time in his Heautontimoreumenos, or Self-Tormenter;
which contains the space of two days. Then, between the second and third
Acts, there’s an absolute failure of the Continuance of the Action.</em>
These are generally believ’d by several Men, and such as are famous too;
and some to vindicate <em>Terence</em> the better have added another
Mistake, <em>That the Play was always acted two several times, the two
first Acts one, and the three last another.</em> But ’tis plain from all
Circumstances, that the <em>Action</em> began very late in the Evening,
and ended betimes in the Morning (of which we have said something in our
<em>Remarks</em> at the end) so that the whole cou’dn’t contain <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘about’">above</ins> Eleven
hours; but as for that of the <em>Cessation of the Action</em>, ’tis
answer’d two ways, either by the necessity of Sleep at that Interval,
and consequently no <em>Cessation</em>, or (which is more probable) by
the Persons being busie at the Treat at <em>Chremes</em>’s House, that
being a necessary part of the main <em>Action</em>. The two following
are Mr. <em>Dryden</em>’s Exceptions; where first he lays an Error to
our Author’s Charge in matter of <em>Time</em>. <em>In the Eunuch</em>
(says he) <em>when <i>Laches</i> enters <i>Thais</i>’s House by mistake,
between his <i>Exit</i> and the Entrance of <i>Pythias</i>, who comes to
give ample Relation of the Disorder he has rais’d within, <i>Parmeno</i>
who is left upon the Stage has not above five
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
<!-- png 22 -->
Lines to speak.</em> In answer to this, <em>Pythias</em> makes no such
<em>ample Relation</em>, but rather tells him what <em>Disorders</em>
such a foolish Act of his was like to raise; and in truth it is not
probable she shou’d stay above five or six Lines speaking, since after
she saw her Cheat had taken, she cou’dn’t keep her countenance within
Doors, and was so eager to revenge her self by laughing at the Fool
without. Besides here’s an excellent Artifice of the Poets, for had she
tarry’d longer, <em>Parmeno</em> might ha’ been gone, and her Mirth
qualified when she saw the good Fortune <em>Chærea</em> had met withal.
His other Exception is, that our Author’s <em>Scenes</em> are several
times broken. He instances in the same Play, <em>That <i>Antipho</i>
enters singly in the midst of the third Act, after <i>Chremes</i> and
<i>Pythias</i> were gone off</em>. As for this, ’tis to be consider’d
that <em>Scenes</em> are united by <em>Time</em> as well as
<em>Presence</em>; and this is a perfect <em>Union of Time</em>,
apparent to all who understand the <em>Art of the Stage</em>. A little
farther he says, <em>That <i>Dorias</i> begins the fourth Act
alone;<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> She quits the Stage,
and <i>Phedria</i> enters next.</em> Here <em>Dorias</em> does not quit
the Stage till three <em>Scenes</em> after, as appears by
<em>Pythias</em>, bidding her carry in such things as she had brought
with her from the Captain’s Entertainment; but if she did, there wou’d
be an <em>Union of Time</em> nevertheless, as there is in all other
places, where the <em>Scenes</em> seem broken. Some make this Objection;
that in the beginning of many Scenes, two <em>Actors</em> enter upon the
Stage, and talk to themselves a considerable time before they see or
know one another; <em>Which</em> (they say) <em>is neither probable nor
natural</em>. Those that object this don’t consider the great Difference
between our little scanty Stage, and the large magnificent <em>Roman
Theatres</em>. Their Stage was sixty Yards wide in the Front, their
Scenes so many Streets meeting together, with all By-Lanes, Rows and
Allies; so two <em>Actors</em> coming down two different Streets or
Lanes cou’dn’t be seen by each other, tho’ the <em>Spectators</em> might
see both, and sometimes if they
<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
<!-- png 23 -->
did see each other they cou’dn’t well distinguish Faces at sixty Yards
distances. Besides upon several accounts it might well be suppos’d when
an <em>Actor</em> enters upon the Stage out of some House, he might take
a turn or two under the <em>Portico’s</em>, <em>Cloysters</em>, or the
like (that were usual at that time) about his Door, and take no notice
of an <em>Actor</em>’s being on the other side the Stage.</p>

<p>But since we propose our Master as the best <em>Model</em> for
<em>Dramatick Poets</em> to follow, we ought in Justice to mention such
things wherein he was any ways faulty, or at least where he ought not to
be imitated. The first is, He makes his <em>Actors</em> in some places
speak directly, and immediately to the <em>Audience</em> (of which that
<em>Monologue</em> of <em>Mysis</em> in the first Act of the first Play
is an instance) which is contrary to the Rules of <em>Dramatick
Poetry</em>, or rather indeed of <em>Nature</em>; and this is the only
real Fault that <em>Terence</em> was guilty of, as his want of <em>Vis
Comica</em> was the only real Defect. His <em>Plots</em> were not always
the best for Story, tho’ for Contrivance, and wanted somewhat of Length
and Variety, fully and compleatly to satisfie an Audience. Take ’em all
together, they were too much alike to have always their deserv’d Effect
of surprizing; which also gave a mighty Limitation to the Variety of his
<em>Characters</em>; a great pity for a Man that had such an admirable
Knack of drawing them to the Life. It were also to be wish’d that his
<em>Monologues</em> or Discourses by single Persons, were less frequent,
and sometimes shorter too; for tho’ they are all of ’em full of
excellent Sence, sound Reasoning, ingenious <em>Deliberations</em>, and
serv’d truly to carry on the main Design; yet several parts of ’em,
especially all <em>Narrations</em>, wou’d ha’ been more natural as well
as Artificial, if told by Persons of the <em>Drama</em> to one another.
Then his <em>Aparts</em> or <em>Asides</em> (that is when one
<em>Actor</em> speaks something which another that is present is
suppos’d to not hear, tho’ the Audience do) are sometimes too long to be
perfectly natural. Whether he
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
<!-- png 24 -->
has not sometimes too much Elevation of Passion, or Borders too nigh
upon <em>Tragedy</em> for such inferior Persons, we leave to others<ins
class = "correction" title = ". invisible">. </ins>These are the main
things to be taken notice of by all that make use of him for a
<em>Model</em>, besides all such as belong purely to the various Customs
of Countries, and to the difference of <em>Theatres</em>; but those are
obvious enough to all.</p>

<p>But there’s still one great Objection against these <em>Plays</em> in
general; that is, <em>If <i>Terence</i>’s Plays are so good as is
pretended, why doesn’t some Poet or other translate one or more of ’em
for the Stage, so save himself the trouble of racking his Brain for new
Matter</em>. We own they wouldn’t take upon our Stage; but to clear all,
we shall give these two Reasons: First, The Difference between the
<em>Romans</em> and our selves in <em>Customs</em>, <em>Humors</em>,
<em>Manners</em> and <em>Theatres</em> is such, that it is impossible to
adapt their Plays to our Stages. The <em>Roman</em> Plots were often
founded upon the exposing of Children, and their unexpected Delivery, on
buying of Misses and Musick-Girls; they were chiefly pleas’d to see a
covetous old Father neatly bubbled by his Slave of a round Sum of Money;
to find the young Spark his Son (miserably in want of Cash) joyn with
the Slave in the Intrigue, that he may get somewhat to stop his
Mistress’s Mouth, whom he keeps unknown to his Father; to see a bragging
Coxcomb wheadled and abus’d by some cunning <em>Parasite</em>; to hear a
Glutton talk of nothing but his Belly, and the like. Our <em>Plots</em>
go chiefly upon variety of Love-Intrigues, Ladies Cuckolding their
Husbands most dextrously; Gallants danger upon the same account, with
their escape either by witty Fetches, or hiding themselves in dark
Holes, Closets, Beds, &amp;c. We are all for Humour, Gallantry,
Conversation, and Courtship, and shou’dn’t endure the chief Lady in the
Play a Mute, or to say very little, <ins class = "correction" title =
"‘s’ invisible">as</ins> ’twas agreeable to them: Our amorous Sparks
love to hear the pretty Rogues prate, snap up their Gallants, and
Repartée upon ’em on all sides. We shou’dn’t
<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
<!-- png 25 -->
like to have a Lady marry’d without knowing whether she gives her
consent or no, (a&nbsp;Custom among the <em>Romans</em>) but wou’d be
for hearing all the Courtship, all the rare and fine things that Lovers
can say to each other. The second Reason of their not taking upon the
Stage is this, tho’ <em>Terence</em>’s Plays are far more
<em>exact</em>, <em>natural</em>, <em>regular</em>, and clear than ours,
and his Persons speak more like themselves than generally ours do; yet
(to speak impartially) our Plays do plainly excel his in some
Particulars. First, in the great Variety of the <em>Matter</em> and
<em>Incidents</em> of our <em>Plots</em>; the Intrigues thicker and
finer; the <em>Stories</em> better, longer, and more curious for the
most part than his: And tho’ there’s much confusion, huddle and
precipitation in the generality of ’em; yet the great variety and number
of <em>Incidents</em> tho’ ill manag’d, will have several Charms, and be
mighty diverting, especially to a vulgar Audience, like the Sight of a
large City at a distance, where there is little of Regularity or
Uniformity to be discern’d just by. Next, we do much excel
<em>Terence</em> in that which we call <em>Humour</em>, that is in our
<em>Comical Characters</em>, in which we have shewn and expos’d the
several Humours, Dispositions, Natures, Inclinations, Fancies,
Irregularities, Maggots, Passions, Whims, Follies, Extravagancies,
&amp;c. of Men under all sorts of Circumstances, of all sorts of
<em>Ranks</em> and <em>Qualities</em>, of all <em>Professions</em> and
<em>Trades</em>, and of all <em>Nations</em> and <em>Countries</em>, so
admirably, and so lively, that in this no Nation among the Ancients or
Moderns were ever comparable to us. Lastly, Our <em>Comedies</em> excel
his in some Delicacies of <em>Conversation</em>; particularly in the
Refinedness of our <em>Railery</em> and <em>Satyr</em>, and above all in
<em>Repartée</em>. Some of these things (especially when mix’d with
<em>Humour</em>) have made many an ordinary <em>Plot</em> take and come
off well; and without a pretty quantity of some of ’em, our Plays wou’d
go down very heavily.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
<!-- png 26 -->
<p>Since we are accidentally fall’n into the Excellencies of our
<em>Comedies</em>, we hope it may be pardonable if we mention also some
principal Faults in ’em, which seem to need a Regulation. And first, Our
<em>Poets</em> seldom or never observe any of the three great
<em>Unities of Action</em>, <em>Time</em> and <em>Place</em>, which are
great Errors; For what breeds more Confusion than to have five or six
main <em>Plots</em> in a Play, when the Audience can never attend to
’em? What more extravagant than to fancy the Actions of Weeks, Months,
and Years represented in the Space of three or four Hours? Or what more
unnatural than for the Spectators to suppose themselves now in a Street,
then in a Garden, by and by in a Chamber, immediately in the Fields,
then in a Street again, and never move out of their place? Wou’dn’t one
swear there was Conjuration in the Case; that the Theatres were a sort
of <em>Fairy Land</em> where all is Inchantment, Juggle and Delusion?
Next, our Plays are too often over-power’d with <em>Incidents</em> and
<em>Under-plots</em>, and our Stage as much crowded with such
<em>Actors</em>, as there’s little or no occasion for; especially at one
time. Then the <em>Matter</em>, and Discourse of our Plays is very often
incoherent and impertinent as to the main Design; nothing being more
common than to meet with two or three whole Scenes in a Play, which
wou’d have fitted any other part of the Play ev’n as well as that; and
perhaps any Play else. Thus some appear to swear out a Scene or two,
others to talk bawdy a little, without any manner of dependance upon the
rest of the Action. But besides this (which is another great Error) when
the <em>Matter</em> and <em>Discourse</em> do serve to carry on the main
Design, commonly Persons are brought on to the Stage without any sort of
Art, Probability, Reason or Necessity for their coming there; and when
they have no such Business as one that comes in to give you a Song or a
Jigg. They come there to serve the Poets Design a little, then off they
go with as little Reason as they came on; and that only to make way for
other Actors, who (as they did)
<span class = "pagenum">xiii</span>
<!-- png 27 -->
come only to tell the Audience something the Poet has a mind to have ’em
know; and that’s all their business: And truly that’s little enough.
This we see frequently in the chief Actor of the Play, who comes on and
goes off, and the Spectators all the time stand staring and wondring at
what they know not what. Another great Fault common to many of our Plays
is, that an Actor’s <em>Name</em>, <em>Quality</em> or <em>Business</em>
is scarce ever known till a good while after his appearance; which must
needs make the Audience at a great Loss, and the Play hard to be
understood, forcing ’em to carry Books with ’em to the
<em>Play-house</em> to know who comes in, and who goes out.</p>

<p>The Ancients were guilty of none of these Absurdities, and more
especially our Author; and indeed the Non-observance of <em>Rules</em>
has occasion’d the great Miscarriages of so many excellent Genius’s of
ours, particularly that of the immortal <em>Shakespear</em>. Since these
are such apparent Faults and Absurdities, and still our Beauties are so
admirable as to cover, and almost to out-weigh our Errors (else our
Plays were not to be endur’d) undoubtedly our <em>Dramatick Poets</em>
by the Observance of this Author’s Ways and Rules might out-do all the
<em>Ancients</em> and <em>Moderns</em> too, both at <em>Tragedy</em> and
at <em>Comedy</em>; for no Nation ever had greater <em>Genius</em>’s
than ours for Dramatick Poetry. These ha’ been but little observ’d as
yet, so that all our fine <em>Imitations of Nature</em> may often be
call’d <em>Lucky hits</em>, and more by Accident than by Art. We very
much need a Reformation in this Case, and our Plays can never arrive to
any great Perfection without it; therefore the nigher they come up to
this Standard, the more they will be admir’d and lov’d by all Judicious
Persons, provided they still keep to those Excellencies
before-mention’d. Besides, these are as easily practicable upon ours as
upon the <em>Greek</em> and <em>Roman</em> Theatres; and by a strict
Observance of the <em>Unity of Place</em>, the Stage may be made far
more handsome and magnificent with less Charge; and by that of
<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
<!-- png 28 -->
the <em>Unity of Action</em> (especially by the help of an Under-plot or
so) the Story may be made far more fine and clear with less trouble.</p>

<p>But our Nation by long Custom, and the Success of Irregular Pieces,
seems naturally averse to all Rules; and take it very ill to have their
Thoughts confin’d and shackled, and tied to the Observance of such
Niceties: Therefore in the first place they tell us, That Poets of all
Men in the World are perfectly freely, and by no means ought to confine
their Noble Fancies to dull pedantick Rules; <em>For this</em> (say
they) <em>is like taking of Bees, cutting off their Wings, and laying
such Flowers before ’em to make Honey as they please</em>. A
<em>Poet</em> indeed shou’d be free, and unconfin’d as Air, as to his
Though, Fancy and Contrivance, but then his <em>Poetica Licentia</em>
shou’dn’t transport him to Madness and Extravagancy, making him
phrensically transgress the Rules of <em>Reason</em> and
<em>Nature</em>, as well as <em>Poetry</em>. These that we mention are
not any Man’s Arbitrary <em>Rules</em>, but pure Nature only Methodiz’d:
They never hamper a <em>Poet</em>’s Fancy or clip his Wings, but adorn
their Thoughts, and regulate their Flights so as to give ’em a clearer
insight into <em>Nature</em>, <em>Probability</em> and <em>Decency</em>,
without something of which it is impossible to please. And these are no
more a <em>Confinement</em> to a <em>Poet</em>’s Fancy, than the true
Proportion of Pillars, the Regularity and Uniformity of Windows are to
an Architect; or the exact Imitation of Nature to a Painter: As if there
could be half so much Beauty in Grotesque and irregular Whims, as in the
due Observation of the Rules of Prospect, Shadows and Proportion.</p>

<p>Another Objection is, <em>That our Nation will never bear Rules, but
are much better pleas’d with the ways now in practice.</em> ’Tis true,
several of our most irregular Plays have come off with a great deal of
Applause, but certainly never the more for their Irregularity; but
because most of the Audience knew no better, being often dazzled by the
<span class = "pagenum">xv</span>
<span class = "folionum">a</span>
<!-- png 29 -->
Greatness of the Author’s Genius, and the Actor’s Performances; and
those that did, were willing to pardon the Faults for the sake of some
choice <em>Master-stroaks</em> they had; and upon the same account a
couple of good <em>Scenes</em> have many times carry’d off a very
indifferent Play: ’Tis plain that want of Use and Knowledge have been
the only Cause of these ways seeming so unpracticable; and if the middle
sort of Persons were once truly brought to a Sight of the Excellencies
of this, and the Deformities of the other way (as the well reading of
these Plays wou’d in a great measure do, being chiefly design’d for
them) they wou’d esteem of it far more than now; and certainly they
cou’d never pardon those many <em>Indecencies</em>,
<em>Improbabilities</em>, <em>Absurdities</em> that are so frequent in
our Plays. ’Tis true, there has been a considerable Regulation among
many of ’em since the Days of <em>Shakespear</em>, but not to bring
things half to perfection. And thus Regulation has made hope for a
further, as the Age will be brought to bear&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The last Objection is more particular: They say, <em>That the Unities
of Action, Time and Place must needs take off from the great Variety of
the Plot, and a fine Story by this means will be quite murder’d.</em>
’Tis true, all <em>Stories</em> whatsoever are not fit for a
<em>Dramatick Poem</em>; yet there may be an excellent <em>Plot</em>
without crowding together Intrigues (little depending upon one another)
of half a dozen couple, suppose, in one Play; without hurrying over the
Business of three Months in three Hours time, or perhaps without
skipping from Gardens to Mountains, from thence to Groves, and then to
Town in an Act or two: But our prying, curious Sparks can’t rest here,
but must be for peeping into Chambers, Closets, and Withdrawing-Rooms,
ay, and into Beds too (sometimes with the Ladies in ’em) and have all
things brought openly upon the Stage, tho’ never so improper, and
indecent. But this Objection may yet be better answer’d by Instances;
and
<span class = "pagenum">xvi</span>
<!-- png 30 -->
first for the <em>Unity of Time</em>, we may mention the Play call’d,
<em>The Adventures of Five Hours</em>, the whole <em>Action</em> lasting
no longer (much less a day, the extent allow’d for a <em>Dramatick
Poem</em>) yet this is one of the pleasantest <em>Stories</em> that ever
appear’d upon our Stage, and has as much Variety of <em>Plots</em> and
<em>Intrigues</em>, without any thing being precipitated, improbable or
unnatural as to the main <em>Action</em>; so by this it appears that
this Rule is no Spoiler or Murderer of a finer <em>Story</em>. Then for
the <em>Unity of Time</em> and Action too, <em>Ben. Johnson’s Silent
Woman</em> is a remarkable Instance; an excellent <em>Comedy</em>
indeed, where the <em>Action</em> is perfectly single, and the utmost
extent of the <em>Time</em> exceeds not three Hours and a half (the
shortest we ever find) yet still the <em>Plot</em>, <em>Intrigues</em>,
and above all the <em>Incidents</em> are very fine, and no ways
unnatural. Lastly, For all three <em>Unities</em>, Mr. <em>Dryden’s All
for Love</em> (tho’ a&nbsp;<em>Tragedy</em>, and somewhat foreign to our
business) is worthy to be taken notice of, that being perfectly
<em>Regular</em> according to the Rules of the Stage, the Scenes
unbroken, the <em>Incidents</em> exactly and duly prepar’d, and all
things noble and beautiful, just and proportionable. This we reckon one
of the best <em>Tragedies</em> of our Nation. Now can any Man justly
think that these Plays we now mention’d were ever the worse for that
<em>Regularity</em> they had; or indeed have we many better in the
Nation for <em>Plot</em>; or many that have better pleas’d the
generality of Persons than these; If so this sufficiently shows the
Truth of what we offered; and withal commends our Master’s great
Judgment in this Point: Who, in our Opinion (besides the Excellency of
his <em>Characters</em>) plainly deserves a greater Name for his
<em>Plots</em>, than he does for his <em>Language</em>.</p>

<p>Come we next then to our own Vindication, in which we shall briefly
shew the <em>Reasons</em> why we did it, and likewise what our
Performances have been in this Version.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xvii</span>
<span class = "folionum">a2</span>
<!-- png 31 -->
<p>The main <em>Reasons</em> why we undertook it were these. First, For
the Excellency and Usefulness of this Author in general: And
consequently for the benefit (as we shall shew by and by) of most sorts
of People, but especially for the Service it may do our <em>Dramatick
Poets</em>. Next, for the Honour of our own <em>Language</em>, into
which all good Books ought to be Translated, since <em>’tis now become
so Elegant, Sweet and Copious</em>: And indeed nothing refines, or gives
Foreigners a greater Opinion of any Language than its number of good
Translations; of which the <em>French</em> is a great Instance. Thirdly,
Because most of our Neighbours have got it in their <em>Language</em>,
particularly the <em>French</em>, who have done it with good Success;
and we have no reason for our being out-done by any of our Neighbours,
since we have a <em>Language</em> we dare set against any in the World.
Lastly, Since the Author is so excellent, we undertook it because no
other Persons wou’d. ’Tis strange that none of our great Wits wou’d
undertake it before, but let us Persons of Obscurity, take their Works
out of their Hands; when we can perceive by our little Performances that
our <em>Language</em> will do it to a very high degree, undoubtedly
better than the <em>French</em>.</p>

<p>The most considerable Objections that have been made against our
Translation are these. First, <em>What real Use or Advantage can this
Translation be to the Publick? As for school-Boys and Learners,
<i>Bernard</i>’s and <i>Hool</i>’s Translations, the great number of
Notes, a&nbsp;School-Master, or their own Industry will well enough
teach ’em to construe it. Men of Sense and Learning, they read it wholly
for the Latin sake; therefore a Translation is of no use to them.</em>
Lastly, <em>They won’t fit our Stage; and consequently they are
impertinent at best.</em> To these we answer; First, As to
<em>School-Boys</em> and <em>Learners</em>; <em>Bernard</em>’s and
<em>Hool</em>’s Translations are very often false, mostly so obsolete,
flat and unpleasant, that a Man can scarce read half a Page without
sleeping; the latter
<span class = "pagenum">xviii</span>
<!-- png 32 -->
is full of <em>Latinisms</em>, and both are often more obscure than the
Original. The <em>Notes</em> sometimes don’t express the Author’s Sense;
and often very obscurely: In some things they are too short<ins class =
"correction" title = ". for ,">, </ins>in others too long and tedious:
And most of them have the slight of running very nimbly over those
Places which they are afraid they shou’d stick in.
<em>School-Masters</em> often want time<ins class = "correction" title =
". for ,">, </ins>and now <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘then and’">and then</ins> Judgment and Learning to explain things as
they ought; then to leave Boys by themselves to pick out the Sense of
such a difficult Author as this, is very inconvenient; which besides the
Discouragement sometimes of not being able to do it, will often lead ’em
into such Errors and Mistakes, as perhaps they’ll ne’re get clear of. So
that this will be of great use even to <em>School-Boys</em> and
<em>Learners</em>: Beside the great Advantage of teaching ’em, perhaps
not the worst <em>English</em>; and something of the Idiom of our
Tongue.</p>

<p>As for the second part of the Objection, <em>That Men of Sense and
Learning read it only for the Latin sake</em>; This is or ought to be
look’d upon as a great Mistake: Since <em>Terence</em> has other and
greater Excellencies than his Style, as we have before shewn. But
however ingenious Persons must needs receive some pleasure in seeing
such excellent Latin now speak tolerable good <em>English</em>; and
likewise in seeing somewhat of the Conversation, Humour and Customs of
the old <em>Greeks</em> and <em>Romans</em> put into a modern Dress; and
perhaps not quite out of the Fashion. Besides, since many of these do
sometimes upon an occasion make use of <em>Notes</em>, ’twill be of
equal use (in that respect) to them as to all <em>Learners</em>. And
that they have often need of such, will appear from the several
difficult places (especially as to the Plot) and some obscure dubious
Passages in this Author, which the utmost Skill in the <em>Latin</em>
Tongue will not teach to explain; since there is as great a necessity
for the understanding of the <em>Roman</em> Customs and Theatres in this
Case, and of the Art of the Stage, as of the <em>Latin</em> Tongue. How
extraordinary useful a
<span class = "pagenum">xix</span>
<span class = "folionum">a3</span>
<!-- png 33 -->
Translation can be in perfectly <em>clearing an Author</em>,
<em>Roscommon</em>’s Translation of <em>Horace</em>’s <em>Art of
Poetry</em> is an apparent Instance; which shews the Sense, Meaning,
Design, &amp;c. of <em>Horace</em> better and easier than all the
<em>Paraphrases</em> and <em>Notes</em> in the World.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Tho’ our <em>Translation</em> will never fit our Stage, yet
it may be of considerable use to some of the <em>Dramatick Poets</em>;
which we had some respect to, when we did it; they will serve ’em (as
was said before) for <em>Models</em>; and tho’ many of our Poets do very
well understand the Original, yet ’tis plain that some of ’em do not
understand it over much. But however, it may not be wholly useless to
those that do, and more proper for their business, being ready explain’d
to their hands: And upon some accounts to be read with less trouble than
the Original: For that is in many places very obscure by reason of
corrupted Copies, wrong Points, false Division of whole <em>Acts</em> as
well as <em>Scenes</em> and the like: Further, if these Plays come to be
frequently read by the more ordinary sort of People, they will by little
and little grow more in love with, and more clearly see the true
Excellencies of these Rules, and these lively <em>Imitations of
Nature</em>, which will be the greatest Encouragement our Poets can have
to follow ’em. And besides, the common People by these <em>Plays</em>
may plainly perceive that <em>Obscenities</em> and <em>Debaucheries</em>
are no ways necessary to make a good <em>Comedy</em>; and the Poets
themselves will be the more ready to blush when they see
<em>Heathens</em> so plainly out-do us <em>Christians</em> in their
<em>Morals</em>; for their principal Vices in their Plays, were chiefly
from the Ignorance of the Times, but we have no such pretence. This
alone might ha’ been a sufficient reason for our undertaking this
Design.</p>

<p>But to come now to what we have done; ’tis not to be expected we
shou’d wholly reach the Air of the Original; that being so peculiar, and
the Language so different; We have imitated our Author as well and as
nigh as the <em>English</em> Tongue and our small Abilities wou’d
permit; each of
<span class = "pagenum">xx</span>
<!-- png 34 -->
us joyning and consulting about every Line, not only for the doing of it
better, but also for the making of it all of a piece. We follow’d no one
<em>Latin</em> Copy by it self, because of the great Disagreements among
’em, but have taken any that seem’d truest. We look’d over all the
<em>Notes</em>, sometimes they would help us a little, and often not;
some hints we had from the <em>French</em><ins class = "correction"
title = ". for ,">, </ins>but not very many; besides we had considerable
helps from other Persons far above our selves, for whose Care and Pains
we shall ever acknowledge our Gratitude. A&nbsp;meer <em>Verbal
Translation</em> is not to be expected, that wou’d sound so horribly,
and be more obscure than the Original; but we have been faithful
Observers of his Sence, and even of his Words too, not slipping any of
consequence without something to answer it; nay farther, where two Words
seem to be much the same, and perhaps not intended to be very different
by the Author, we were commonly so nice as to do them too; such as
<em>Segnitia</em> and <em>Socordia</em>, <em>Scire</em> and
<em>Noscere</em>, and the like, which is more exact than most, if not
all, our modern Versions. We cou’dn’t have kept closer (especially in
this Author, which several ingenious Persons told us, <em>Is the hardest
in the World to translate</em>;) without too much treading upon the
Author’s Heels, and destroying our Design of giving it an easie,
<em>Comick Style</em>, most agreeable to our present Times. If we have
been guilty of any Fault of this nature, it seems to be that of keeping
too close.</p>

<p>But still to be more particular; we did all we cou’d to prevent any
of the Meaning and Grace of the best <em>Words</em> to be lost; so that
we were often forc’d to search and study some time for those most
proper, and oftentimes to express ’em by two, and sometimes by a
<em>Circumlocution</em>: Which Madam <em>Dacier</em> her self, as
accurate as she is accompted, has often neglected: And thereby has
wholly lost the Force and Beauty of many Emphatical Words.
<em>Terence</em> had some Words taken in a great many several Sences,
such as <em>Contumelia</em> and <em>Injuria</em>, <em>Odiosus</em>,
<em>Tristis</em>, <ins class = "correction" title = "missing punctuation, OR error for ‘These’">&amp;c. these</ins> we
<span class = "pagenum">xxi</span>
<span class = "folionum">a4</span>
<!-- png 35 -->
have been very careful about; but where he plays upon Words (tho’ never
so prettily) he ought not in some places to be imitated at all, because
the Fineness is more lost that way, than the other; yet we try’d at
several when they were Natural and tolerable in <em>English</em>. As for
his <em>Allusions</em> and the like, many of them perhaps are quite lost
to us. However they are commonly lost in our Language. On such places
(as well as some others) we made <em>Remarks</em> or <em>Notes</em> at
the latter end; some of which we are oblig’d to the <em>French</em> Lady
for; these serving to shew our Author’s fine Stroaks, as well as to
vindicate our Translation. For his <em>Sense</em> and <em>Meaning</em>,
we have taken more than ordinary care about, and weigh’d all
Circumstances before we fix’d. Several of the Passages are done contrary
to the general Opinion, and some few differently from all, both as to
the <em>Person that speaks</em> as well as the <em>Meaning</em>, but not
without good Grounds; and if any be so nice in censuring, we desire that
Person to shew us three <em>Terences</em> that exactly agree with one
another, either in Points or Words, for two Acts together. Of those
Passages that were absolutely doubtful, we always took the best, and
that, which seem’d to us, the most probable Way and Meaning; and all
such as were difficult, knotty or obscure in the Original, we made as
plain and clear as we cou’d; and we presume to phansie there are very
few Passages in ours, unintelligible to the meanest Capacity. In his
<em>Jests</em> and <em>Repartees</em> (except they were
<em>Allusions</em> or the like) we hope that the force of ’em is seldom
lost. For making every Person speak so exactly like themselves
(a&nbsp;thing that our Author was so famous for) is much more difficult
in <em>English</em> by reason of its greater variety of <em>Idioms</em>
and <em>Phrases</em> than in the <em>Latin</em>; and to suit these
always right, requires a greater <em>Genius</em> than we can pretend to.
<em>Terence</em>, tho’ reckon’d very genteel in his Days, seems in some
place to have a sort of familiarity and bluntness in his Discourse, not
so agreeable with the Manners and Gallantry
<span class = "pagenum">xxii</span>
<!-- png 36 -->
of our Times; which we have mollify’d as well as we cou’d, still making
the <em>Servants</em> sawcy enough upon occasion. In some places we have
had somewhat more of <em>Humour</em> than the Original, to make it still
more agreeable to our Age; but all the while have kept so nigh our
Author’s <em>Sence</em> and <em>Design</em>, that we hope it can never
be justly call’d a Fault. We can’t certainly tell whither
<em>William</em> the Conqueror, the <em>Grand Seignior</em> (and the
like) may pass with some: They may possibly take <ins class =
"correction" title = "’ missing or invisible">’em</ins> for Blunders in
time: which are now become Proverbial Expressions; the first signifying
only a great while ago, and t’other a great Man.</p>

<p>As for the Division of the <em>Acts</em> and <em>Scenes</em>, all the
common <em>Terences</em> are most notoriously false: The <em>Acts</em>
are often wrong, but the <em>Scenes</em> oftener; and these have bred
some obscurity in our Author’s <em>Rules</em>. Madam <em>Dacier</em> has
been more exact in this than all others before her; yet, still she’s
once mistaken in her <em>Acts</em>, and very often in her
<em>Scenes</em>. We have follow’d her as to her <em>Acts</em>, except
one in the <em>Phormio</em>; but we have not divided the <em>Scenes</em>
at all by Figures, because they are of no such use; only the Reader may
take notice that whenever any particular <em>Actor</em> enters upon the
Stage, or goes off, that makes a different <em>Scene</em>; for the
<em>Ancients</em> never had any other that we know of. The
<em>Prologues</em>, by the Advice of several Judicious Persons, are left
out, as being the Meanest, the fullest of Quibbles, and the least
Intelligible of any thing he wrote: They relating chiefly to private
Squabbles between our <em>Author</em> and the <em>Poets</em> of his
time: The Particulars of which ’tis impossible for us to understand now,
and we need not be much concern’d that we don’t. Besides, in the main,
they are so much beneath the <em>Author</em>, that ’tis much question’d
whether they are his or no, especially the Third. The <em>Arguments</em>
are certainly none of his, and so far from being useful, that they only
serve to forestall the <em>Plots</em>, and take away the Pleasure of
surprizing.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xxiii</span>
<!-- png 37 -->
<p>Lastly, That there might be nothing wanting that might make this
Translation as intire and clear as possible; we’ve all the way
intermix’d <em>Notes of Explanation</em>, such as, <em>Enter</em>,
<em>Exit</em>, <em>Asides</em>, and all other things of <em>Action</em>,
necessary to be known, and constantly practis’d among our Modern
<em>Dramatick Poets</em>. These serve extreamly to the clearing of the
<em>Plots</em> which wou’d be obscure without ’em; especially since
their Theatres were so different from ours. And as this sort of
<em>Notes</em> are the <em>shortest</em>, that are generally us’d, so
they are most <em>compleat</em>, <em>useful</em> and <em>clear</em>, by
the help of which any Child almost may apprehend every thing. Perhaps we
might have omitted some of ’em, but we have <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘beeter’">better</ins> offend this way than the
other.</p>

<p>Thus have we said as much as we thought requisite in Vindication of
our Master’s Honour, and of our own Undertaking. And if we had said ten
times as much; and ne’re so much to the purpose, People will still
think, and talk what they please, and we can’t help&nbsp;it.</p>

<h4>THE</h4>

<h1><span class = "extended">PREFACE</span>.</h1>


<p><span class = "firstletter">T</span>His Nations Excellencies in
<em>Dramatick Poetry</em> have been so extraordinary, and our
Performance both in <em>Tragedy</em> and <em>Comedy</em> have discover’d
such strange <em>Genius</em>’s, that we have some reason to believe,
that we have not only surpass’d our Neighbours the Moderns, but likewise
have excell’d our Masters the Ancients. But the want of Knowledge of the
Ancients has been one great Reason for our setting our selves so very
much above ’em; for tho’ we have many Beauties which they wanted, yet it
must be own’d, that they have more which we have not, except that it may
be some very few of our Pieces. But then their Excellencies are far less
known to us than ours; for the Common People are unacquainted with their
Languages, and the more Learned sort, for want of due Observance and
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Penitration’">Penetration</ins>, have been ignorant enough of their
essential Beauties; they, for the most part, contenting themselves with
considering the <em>superficial</em> ones, such as the <em>Stile</em>,
<em>Language</em>, <em>Expression</em>, and the like, without taking
much notice of the Contrivance and Management, of the <em>Plots</em>,
<em>Characters</em>,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<!-- png 42 -->
<p>But a considerable Discovery of these Excellencies has been made by
means of a late Version of <em>Terence</em>, especially by the help of
the <em>Preface</em> and <em>Remarks</em>: And this has made me hope,
that two or three Plays of <em>Plautus</em>’s cou’d not be very
unacceptable after them; and since the principal Fault of the
<em>Remarks</em> in that Version was their being too short, I&nbsp;have
made these somewhat longer and clearer, hoping they will prove the
principal means of recommending this Book to the World, even tho’ the
Translation had been brought to the utmost Perfection it was capable of:
a&nbsp;Thing which I dare never pretend to. I&nbsp;made Choice of the
same three which Madam <em>Dacier</em> had done before me; those being,
in many respects, fitter for my purpose. But before I come to
Particulars in those Things, I&nbsp;shall give some Character and
Account of my Author.</p>

<p><em>Plautus</em>, if consider’d as a <em>Dramatick Poet</em>, may
justly enough be stil’d the Prince of the <em>Latin Comedians</em>, for
tho’ most of ’em are lost, and consequently little capable of being
judg’d of, yet, from all Circumstances, we have good reason to presume
that they never came up to <em>Plautus</em>; so that there is no one to
stand in competition with him but <em>Terence</em>: But if
<em>Comedy</em> consists more in <em>Action</em> than
<em>Discourse</em>, then <em>Terence</em> himself must be oblig’d to
give place to our Author; and as <em>Terence</em> ought to be esteem’d
as a Man who spoke admirably, <em>Plautus</em> is to be admir’d as a
<em>Comick-Poet</em>. The principal Differences of these two Poets have
been touch’d upon in the Preface to the English <em>Terence</em>; and
from thence it will appear, that <em>Plautus</em> had the vaster
<em>Genius</em>, and
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<span class = "folionum">a2</span>
<!-- png 43 -->
<em>Terence</em> the more exquisite Judgment; and, considering what
Persons they copied, as the later was call’d the <em>Half Menander</em>,
so the former may be stil’d the <em>Half Aristophanes</em>.</p>

<p><em>Terence</em>’s Stile was generally more refin’d and pure, and
withal more elaborate than this Poet’s; yet undoubtedly,
<em>Plautus</em> was a most absolute Master of his Tongue, and in many
Places there appear such a Sharpness and Liveliness of Expression, nay
and such a Neatness and Politeness too, that is scarce to be found in
<em>Terence</em>; and this, perhaps, may have occasion’d <em>Varro</em>
to say, <em>That if the Muses were to speak Latin, they wou’d certainly
make use of his very Stile</em>; and <em>Tanaquill Faber</em> to call
<em>Plautus</em>, <em>The very Fountain of pure Latin</em>. As to
<em>Wit</em> and <em>Raillery</em>, <em>Terence</em> might by no means
be compared to him; then he is not always so happy, but often
degenerates to a Meanness that <em>Terence</em> wou’d never have been
guilty of; and tho’ his <em>Jests</em> and <em>Repartees</em> were
sometimes admirable, and often far above <em>Terence</em>’s, yet they
were many times as much below him, and by their Trifling and Quibbling,
appear to have been calculated for the Mob. This, probably, made
<em>Rapin</em> observe, <em>That he says the best Things in the World,
and yet very often he says the most wretched.</em> A little before he
says, <em><i>Plautus</i> is ingenious in his Designs, happy in his
Imaginations, fruitful in his Invention; yet, that there are some
insipid Jests that escape from him in the Taste of <i>Horace</i>; and
his good Sayings that make the People laugh, make sometimes the honester
sort to pity him.</em> The most remarkable Thing in his Stile,
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<!-- png 44 -->
is the natural and unaffected <em>Easiness</em> of it, I&nbsp;mean in
opposition to <em>Stiffness</em>, which with the true <em>Elegance</em>
and <em>Propriety</em> of the <em>Latin</em> Tongue in <em>Common
Discourse</em>, seems almost its distinguishing Character, and sets him
above any other <em>Roman</em> Author in that respect. ’Tis true,
<em>Terence</em> has all these Excellencies, and perhaps is more exact
in <em>Propriety of Terms</em>, and in his Choice of <em>Words</em>, yet
his extream Closeness and great Elaborateness, I&nbsp;presume, has made
it somewhat less <em>Free</em> and <em>Familiar</em>, or at least it
wou’d be so if any other Man of less Judgment had managed it. So that
what I mean is, that <em>Plautus</em>’s Stile ought rather to be
imitated for <em>Common Discourse</em> than <em>Terence</em>’s.
<em>Plautus</em> had the Misfortune of living in a worser Age than
<em>Terence</em>, therefore there must be a larger Allowance for his
<em>Obsolete Words</em>, his <em>Puns</em>, and <em>Quibbles</em>, as
well as those Words that were peculiar to the Theatre and his Subjects,
which, if once transplanted, wou’d never thrive elsewhere.</p>

<p>Next, may be consider’d our Authors <em>Characters</em>; and in that
point indeed, <em>Terence</em> triumphs without a Rival, as was observ’d
in the <em>Preface</em> to that Author; and for a just and close
Observance of <em>Nature</em>, perhaps no Man living ever excell’d him.
It ought to be observ’d, that <em>Plautus</em> was somewhat poor, and
made it his principal Aim to please and tickle the Common People; and
since they were almost always delighted with something new, strange, and
unusual, the better to humour them, he was not only frequently
extravagant in his <em>Expressions</em>, but likewise in his
<em>Characters</em> too, and drew Men often more Vicious,
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<span class = "folionum">a3</span>
<!-- png 45 -->
more Covetous, more Foolish, &amp;c. than generally they were; and this
to set the People a gazing and wondering. With these sort of
<em>Characters</em> many of our modern <em>Comedies</em> abound, which
makes ’em too much degenerate into <em>Farce</em>, which seldom fail of
pleasing the Mob. But our Author had not many of these; for a great part
of ’em were very true and natural, and such as may stand the Test of the
severest Judges. His two most remarkable <em>Characters</em>, are his
<em>Miser</em>, and his <em>Bragadocio</em>; and that the Reader may the
more clearly understand the nature of these <em>Characters</em>, their
Resemblance to some of ours, and their Unlikeness to those of
<em>Terence</em>, I shall give a Translation of some part of ’em. First
then, take the First Act of his Third Comedy call’d <em>Aulularia</em>,
which begins with the Old Covetous Fellow and his Maid.</p>

Particulars, but leave the Reader to judge their Differences; but only I
may observe, that when <em>Characters</em> are carry’d too high, as many
of ours are, they may probably make an Audience laugh very heartily, but
can give ’em but small Pleasure; whereas others will give ’em great
Delight, tho’ less Laughter.</p>

<p>I am afraid I have dwelt too long upon this Subject, therefore I pass
on to our Author’s <em>Plots</em>. In that respect, he had not often
that <em>Art</em> and <em>Management</em> that <em>Terence</em> had, nor
in all his Plays was so <em>regular</em> as he; tho’ in several he was,
particularly in those I have chosen. But then his Scenes were commonly
less languishing, his <em>Incidents</em> more surprizing, and his
<em>Surprizes</em> more admirable; undoubtedly he had more of the
<em>Vis comica</em>, which I may translate <em>Liveliness of
Intreague</em>, than <em>Terence</em>. His <em>Subjects</em> were all
more <em>Simple</em> than the other’s, but I am apt to believe, that
will be reckon’d but a very small Commendation in our Nation, who are
but little Lovers of such thin Dyet, as they call it. His
<em>Narrations</em> are more lively and sharp than those of
<em>Terence</em>’s, and, I&nbsp;think, every whit as natural and as well
brought in: I’m sure in some of ’em he can never be out-done as to his
way of bringing of ’em in. As for the General Rules of the Stage,
I&nbsp;refer the Reader to the Preface to <em>Terence</em>.</p>

<p>Our Author’s principal Fault was, his mixing the
<em>Representation</em> with the <em>Theatral Action</em> in many
places, where he often makes his Actors speak immediately and directly
to the Spectators; a&nbsp;Fault that <em>Terence</em> was not wholly
free from. This our
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<!-- png 56 -->
modern Plays, I&nbsp;think, are never guilty of; only in our
<em>Monologues</em> and <em>Asides</em>, our Actors have got a custom of
looking so full upon the Spectators, that it seems but one degree
better. But our Author is not guilty of this in these three Plays,
except in <em>Amphitryon</em>, and that by way of <em>Prologue</em>, or
of any other Faults but what, I&nbsp;believe, I&nbsp;have shewn in my
<em>Remarks</em>. And these that I have here chosen, are no ways
inferior to <em>Terence</em>’s in matters of <em>Plot</em> and
<em>Intreague</em>, but in some respects superior, tho’ not so
elaborately wrought up, or always with that Niceness; so that these may
undoubtedly prove excellent Models for our Poets Imitation, provided
they observe Differences of Tastes, Humours, Ages, and Persons, and keep
to those principal Beauties they already possess, some of which are
undoubtedly above the Ancients. Only <em>Terence</em> will teach ’em one
thing that <em>Plautus</em> does not, to wit, the great Cunning of
working in <em>Under-Plots</em>, and still preserving the <em>Unity of
Action</em>; for <em>Plautus</em> has none of them. As for the Necessity
of Rules, the Objections against ’em, and the wonderful Perfection our
Plays might arrive to by a more close Observance of ’em, I&nbsp;must
once more refer my Reader to the Preface to <em>Terence</em>. It was
principally upon the Poets Account, and for all such as are desirous of
understanding and judging the Excellencies of Dramatick Poetry, that I
translated these Plays. If it be objected, that the Poets, Criticks, and
Lovers, as well as Judges of Dramatick Poetry, do most of ’em understand
the Original; I&nbsp;must deny the Truth of it, tho’ several of ’em do:
But if they did, these will be much more proper for their
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<span class = "folionum">b</span>
<!-- png 57 -->
Design, especially by means of the <em>Notes</em> and <em>Remarks</em>;
and the Reasons I urg’d for the translation of <em>Terence</em>, bear a
greater force in this Author, for here is a greater Obscurity, by reason
of corrupted Copies, wrong Points, false Divisions of whole Acts as well
as Scenes, besides a greater number of knotty and obscure Passages, than
in <em>Terence</em>.</p>

<p>Tho’ this was my principal, it was not my only Design of translating
this Author, for I had all the way an Eye to School boys, and Learners
of the <em>Latin</em> Tongue: Therefore, upon that account, I&nbsp;have
not only kept perfectly close to his Sence, but almost always to his
Words too; a&nbsp;thing not only extream difficult in an Author so
frequently verbose, but oftentimes dangerous too: And for an Instance,
I&nbsp;need not go any further than the very first Sentence of the
<em>Prologue</em> to <em>Amphitryon</em>, which if I had made shorter,
I&nbsp;cou’d have made better. I&nbsp;can’t forbear mentioning a Passage
in the third Act of the same Play, which just now comes to my
remembrance:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Nam certo si sis sanus, aut sapias satis,</p>
<p>Quam tu impudicam esse arbitrare, &amp; prædicas,</p>
<p>Cum ea tu sermonem nec joco, nec serio</p>
<p>Tibi habeas, nisi sis stultior stultissimo.</p>
</div>

<p>Which I have translated, perhaps, too closely thus; <em>I’m sure, had
ye either Wit, or Discretion, or weren’t the greatest Fool in Nature,
you’d ne’er hold Discourse, either in Mirth or Earnest, with the Woman
you believe and declare a Strumpet.</em> I’m confident many other
Translators wou’d not have been
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<!-- png 58 -->
so scrupulously nice, but have made shorter work of it. But I have not
only been so scrupulous in this Case, but I have likewise imitated all
his Faults and Imperfections, whenever I cou’d do it without extream
Injury to the Translation; I&nbsp;speak of his <em>Puns</em>,
<em>Quibbles</em>, <em>Rhimes</em>, <em>Gingles</em>, and his several
ways of playing upon words; which indeed were the Faults of his Age, as
it was of ours in <em>Shakespear</em>’s and <em>Johnson</em>’s days, and
of which <em>Terence</em>, as correct as he is, is not perfectly clear.
Our Author’s playing upon words are of that various nature, and so
frequent too, I&nbsp;need not go far for a single Instance, which shall
be in the fore part of the Prologue to <em>Amphitryon</em>:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Justam rem &amp; facilem esse oratum à vobis volo.</p>
<p>Nam juste ab justis sum orator datus.</p>
<p>Nam injusta ab justis impetrare non decet:</p>
<p>Justa autem ab injustis petere, insipientia&nbsp;’st:</p>
<p>Quippe illi iniqui jus ignorant, neque tenent.</p>
</div>

<p>Which I have translated thus: <em>I desire nothing but what’s
reasonable, and feasible; for ’tis a reasonable God requires Reason from
a reasonable People; but to require Roguery from reasonable People, is
base; and to expect Reason from Rascals, is nonsence; since such People
neither know Reason nor observe it.</em> Our Author’s Wit did many times
consist in his playing upon Words; a&nbsp;great pity indeed, for a
person who was so well able to writ after a more substantial way, of
which we have many remarkable Instances. Besides his Quibbling, partly
from his Carelesness and Necessities, he hath sometimes a vein of
<em>Trifling</em>, which was but very indifferent;
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<span class = "folionum">b2</span>
<!-- png 59 -->
and on those places the Reader must make some allowance for the
translation, and not expect more than the Matter will well bear. As for
our Author’s <em>Jests</em> and <em>Repartees</em>, for what we know of
’em, I&nbsp;took a particular care in preserving their Force; and for
the most part, I&nbsp;presume, I&nbsp;have done it in a great measure,
sometimes by a lucky hit; or a peculiar happiness of our Tongue, other
times by a little Liberty taken, and when all have fail’d, the
<em>Remarks</em> have generally supply’d the Defect, a&nbsp;way I was
forc’d to content my self withal in many places; the worse they were,
they were frequently more difficult to preserve, therefore I thought it
as well to slur over some few of the meaner sort. Several of his
<em>Jests</em> and bits of <em>Satyr</em> are undoubtedly lost to us,
not only in respect of our Language, but also our Knowledge, and this
sometimes makes his <em>Sence</em> a little obscure. And as the
<em>Sence</em> of an Author ought to be his Translator’s chiefest Care,
so it has been mine; and tho’ I&nbsp;cannot affirm, that I have kept to
it in every passage, yet I believe I have often done it where a common
Reader will think I have not; and I think it no commendation to my self
to say I have hit it on many places where the Common Interpreters have
missed.</p>

<p>After all, I dare not pretend to say, that this Translation equals
the Original, for there is such a peculiar Air in this Author as well as
<em>Terence</em>, that our Tongue seems uncapable of, or at least it
does so to me. Yet still if ’twere always read with the Original, it
wou’d make far more for me than otherwise. In short, the Reader ought to
look upon this as a Translation of an Author who had several Faults, and
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<!-- png 60 -->
such places, as the <em>English</em> must of necessity appear mean,
being little better in the Original; and likewise as an Author of
Antiquity, some of whose Customs and Manners will appear a little
uncouth and unsightly, in spight of all a Translator’s Care.
I&nbsp;endeavour’d to be as like my Author as I cou’d, especially in
that which I reckon his distinguishing Character, to wit, the natural
and unaffected easiness of his Stile, and as this seems the most capable
of imitation, so I believe I have been more successful in this
Particular than in any other: and that is the main Reason I have had so
many Abbreviations, to make it appear still more like common Discourse,
and the usual way of speaking. Perhaps I may be thought to have been too
bold in that point, because I have had some that are not usual in Prose;
therefore I don’t set this way as a Copy for any one to follow me in,
nor shall I use it myself in any other Piece. I&nbsp;have all the way
divided the <em>Acts</em> and <em>Scenes</em> according to the true
Rules of the Stage, which are extreamly false in all the Editions of
this Author, especially the <em>Scenes</em>.</p>

<p>To make this Translation the most useful that I cou’d, I&nbsp;have
made <em>Remarks</em> upon each Play, and those are of two sorts, tho’
equally intermix’d: The first, to shew the Author’s chief Excellencies
as to his Contrivance and Management of his <em>Plots</em> and
<em>Incidents</em>; the second, to discover several Beauties of
<em>Stile</em> and <em>Wit</em>, principally such as are not very clear,
or cannot well be preserv’d in our Tongue; and those are likewise to
vindicate my Translation. Several of these I must own my self oblig’d to
Madam
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<!-- png 61 -->
<em>Dacier</em> for, or at least the hint, tho’ some of ’em I cou’d not
have miss’d of in the prosecution of those Designs I aim’d at.
I&nbsp;have borrow’d little or nothing from any other, for her’s are far
the best <em>Notes</em> I ever met with, tho’ many of ’em were done more
to shew her Parts and Reading than for any real use, a&nbsp;thing which
I shall never aim at. I&nbsp;have been forc’d in most of ’em to be
extream nice and curious in penetrating into the bottom of the Author,
for I find it far more difficult to discover a Beauty than a Fault.
I&nbsp;might have enlarg’d upon ’em, and have made several more, with
good grounds, but I thought it dangerous to say all that cou’d be said;
but instead of that I was forc’d, much against my will, to dash out
several of those upon <em>Amphitryon</em> upon the account of the
Printer, but the rest are more full and compleat.</p>

<p>If business wou’d have permitted me, I&nbsp;shou’d have ventur’d upon
three more of our Authors Plays; and upon that Account, I&nbsp;have
taken somewhat less time than was necessary for the translating such an
extraordinary difficult Author; for this requires more than double the
time of a <em>Historian</em> or the like, which was as much as I cou’d
allow my self. I&nbsp;made choice of these three Plays as well for their
<em>Modesty</em> as <em>Regularity</em>, for above all things I wou’d by
no means give the least Encouragement to Lewdness or Obscenity, which
grow too fast of themselves; and therefore I thought I cou’d not chuse
better than after a Lady. <em>Amphitryon</em> had the Name, and never
fail’d of a general Approbation; <em>Epidicus</em> was our Author’s
Favourite, and truly there is much Art in it, tho’ it
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<!-- png 62 -->
is a little heavy; and <em>Rudens</em> is in several respects a better
Play than any of <em>Plautus</em>’s or <em>Terence</em>’s. I’m afraid
<em>Amphitryon</em> will bear the worse in our Tongue, upon the Account
of Mr. <em>Dryden</em>’s, whose Improvements are very extraordinary; but
considering Mr. <em>Dryden</em>’s Management is of such a different
Nature, this will still be as useful and as proper for my
<em>Design</em>, or at least to School-boys and Learners. I&nbsp;must do
that great Man the Justice in saying, that he has not only much improved
the <em>Humour</em>, <em>Wit</em>, and <em>Design</em> in many places,
but likewise the <em>Thoughts</em>. I’ll mention one, which just now
comes into my mind. <em>Alcmena</em> in the Second Act complains thus:
<em>How poor and short are this Life’s Pleasures, if once compar’d with
the Sorrows we endure? ’Tis Man’s Destiny, and Heaven’s Pleasure, to mix
our Joys with bitter Potions; and for some few Hours of Satisfaction, we
meet with Ages of Ills and Troubles.</em> Mr. <em>Dryden</em>, by the
help of Blank Verse, and a little more room, has better’d it
extreamly.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Ye niggard Gods! you make our Lives too long:</p>
<p>You fill ’em with Diseases, Wants, and Woes,</p>
<p>And only dash ’em with a little Love;</p>
<p>Sprinkled by Fits, and with a sparing Hand.</p>
<p>Count all our Joys, from Childhood ev’n to Age,</p>
<p>They wou’d but make a Day of ev’ry Year:</p>
</div>

<p>And to carry it on further yet, and to make it appear more fine and
clear, he says,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Take back your Sev’nty Years, (the stint of Life)</p>
<p>Or else be kind, and cram the Quintessence</p>
<p>Of Sev’nty Years into sweet Sev’nty Days:</p>
<p>For all the rest is flat, insipid Being.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">|</span>
<!-- png 63 -->
<p>I mention this the rather, because it may serve for one Instance of
what Improvements our Modern Poets have made on the Ancients, when they
built upon their Foundations. For we find that many of the fine things
of the Ancients are like Seeds, that, when planted on <em>English</em>
Ground by a Skilful Poet’s Hand, thrive, and produce excellent
Fruit.</p>

<p>But I’m afraid this <em>Preface</em> has been too long and tedious
for this small Piece; but the Press stays, and the hast I’m in will not
permit me to make it shorter, or so much as review it; yet before I
conclude, I&nbsp;must inform the Reader, that I had the Advantage of
another’s doing their <em>P</em>lays before me; from whose Translation I
had very considerable Helps, especially in the <em>Jests</em> and
<em>Quibbles</em>.</p>
